# TensorFlow.js Example: Training MNIST

This example shows you how to train MNIST.

This model will compute accuracy over 1000 random test set examples every 5
steps, plotting loss and accuracy as the model is training. Training time can
be reduced by computing accuracy over fewer examples less often.

This model can be trained for two types of dataset: the original MNIST and [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).

This model is adapted from [cmash's work](https://github.com/cmasch/zalando-fashion-mnist) and achieved similar results training in the browser.
